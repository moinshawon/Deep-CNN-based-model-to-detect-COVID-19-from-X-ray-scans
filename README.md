# Deep-CNN-based-model-to-detect-COVID-19-from-X-ray-scans

Applied manual CNN architecture and transfer learning to detect COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. Manual CNN model built with five Conv2D layers, 2 FC, and the sigmoid activation function to classify covid+ or covid-. DenseNet121 was applied as a transfer learning model. After comparison, received 96.93\% \& 97.43\% accuracy.
